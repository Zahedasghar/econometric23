## Course overview and learning outcomes

Research in economics, business and finance requires extensive use of sophisticated and refined quantitative skills. In this course you will be introduced to the models and econometric issues that occur when dealing with time series data. Applications of econometric tools to economics and finance will be stressed. Students completing this class will be able to select right tool for the task, apply the relevant econometric model to data, be able to understand and deal with underlying models and be able to estimate and interpret results of econometric models in right way. Students will acquire competence in the tools and methods used in modern econometric research with a focus on theoretical knowledge, critical reasoning, problem solving, interpretation and evaluation.

## Instructional Method

**Structure** -- The course has 3 main parts: learning a tools, which tool for which situation, and learning each and every step by doing using R (I ll give hints for STATA) software.

## Main texts
We will mainly use two books.

[**Mostly Harmless Econometrics: An Empiricist's Companion**](http://www.mostlyharmlesseconometrics.com/) *(MHE)*\
*by Angrist and Pischke*\
Your new best friend. Read it.

[**Econometric Analysis**](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Greene-Econometric-Analysis-8th-Edition/PGM334862.html) *(Greene)*\
*by Greene*\
The standard---an encyclopedic resource for many of the questions MHE does not answer.


Also very readable and accessible.

### Runners up

[**Introduction to Causal Inference**](https://www.bradyneal.com/causal-inference-course) *(Neal)*\
*by Brady Neal*\
A free, under-development, causal-inference book targeting folks who come from a prediction (think: machine learning) background.

## Course contents

Week 01: Review Chapter 1 MHE

Week 02: The Experimental Ideal

Readings: MHE chapter 2

Week 03: Why Regression?

What's the big deal about least-squares (population) regression?
What does the CEF tell us?
How does least-squares regression relate to the CEF?


Readings: MHE chapter 3.1

Week 04: Inference and Simulation

How do we move from populations to samples?
What matters for drawing basic statistical inferences about the population?
How can we learn about inference from simulation?
How do we run (parallelized) simulations in R?

Readings: MHE chapter 3

Week 05: Regression Stuff

Assumptions: Hetroscedasticity, Multiollineairty and Autocorrelation
Nature and consequences and solution


Week 06: Controls

## Data Science

-   [You go into data analysis with the tools you know, not the tools you need]{.hi}

-   The next 2-3 weeks are all about giving you the tools you need

    -   Admittedly, a bit before you know what you need them *for*

-   We will extend them as we learn specific models

## R

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   **Free** and **open source**

-   A very large community

    -   Written by statisticians for statistics
    -   Most packages are written for `R` first

-   Can handle virtually any data format

-   Makes replication easy

-   Can integrate into documents (with `R markdown`)

-   R is a *language* so it can do *everything*

    -   A good stepping stone to learning other languages like *Python*

## Excel (or Stata) Can't Do This

::: panel-tabset
## Code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = gapminder, 
       aes(x = gdpPercap,
           y = lifeExp,
           color = continent))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
	scale_x_log10(breaks=c(1000,10000, 100000),
	              label=scales::dollar)+
	labs(x = "GDP/Capita",
	     y = "Life Expectancy (Years)")+
  facet_wrap(~continent)+
  guides(color = F)+
  theme_light()
```

## Output

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
ggplot(data = gapminder, 
       aes(x = gdpPercap,
           y = lifeExp,
           color = continent))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
	scale_x_log10(breaks=c(1000,10000, 100000),

	     y = "Life Expectancy (Years)")+
  facet_wrap(~continent)+
  guides(color = F)+

### Output

The average GDP per capita is `r dollar(mean(gapminder$gdpPercap))` with a standard deviation of `r dollar(sd(gapminder$gdpPercap))`.
